# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The requirements document is a business-minded document, which is supposed to include very few technical details.
Here you will write the introduction to what your project is supposed to be. You will describe the functionality in details, without being too specific. An example could be 

```bash
This app is a booking system for therapist, with different kinds of users, and a place to book reservations at the therapists calendar.
```

### The requirements documents design

The design of this document will be that of a user story mapping. It will look something like this:

```bash
