# Design Document

## Introduction

The design document is the technical document that holds all the architecural information about your project.
It should include a high-level architecure (given that the more detailed architecture are described in the readme and documentation for each part) as well as an overview of the Core Components to whatever you are building. 

This should also describe error handling and testing strategy
